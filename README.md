=== READ ME ===

To use this script you must have a free API Key from openweathermap.org.
Without this API key the script will not be able to find the weather.

The script will generate a file called: droneweatherpreferences.dat on the same directory as the script.
This data file holds the user preferences and can be deleted by the user after use of program if they so choose.
If deleted, the script will ask the user for questions and create a new droneweatherpreferences.dat file when starting script.

=== DISCLAIMER ===

This is a fun side project. This program was created to try use an API in a practical way in aviation.

This script may be inaccurate at times and other methods must be used to ensure safe flight.
